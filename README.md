# Edwardâ€™s dotfiles

These are my dotfiles: configuration files that are usually placed in my home directory.

These files, like `.bash_profile`, configure various tools as well as provide extra features like the alias commands I like using. `gfp` is a favourite of mine.

Let me know if they help you out!
